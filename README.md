> Game of PingPong to Play in your Vim, written in VimL : mother of recursion


```
It is not complete as I am unable to think any way to implement a timer like thing
```

```
one day I played with Vim, bit more than my usual day and came with idea of this game
```

```
I completed book 'Learn Vimscript the Hardway' last week : so tried all sort of VimL things in this
```

```
I tried many many things but still my recursive function says
```

```viml
E132: Function call depth is higher than 'maxfuncdepth'
```
